* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Language Model trained on GloVe word embeddings of headlines dataset
* Bigram Language Model

## Datasets

* Subset of [A Million News Headlines](https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/million-headlines)
* [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)

## Dependencies

* [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)
